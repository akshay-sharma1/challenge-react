1. How many hours did you spend on this challenge?

I spent approximately 2 hours. 

2. Describe the features you have implemented.

I've implemented the standard quiz from UnderTheButton using 
Material-UI as the primary design framework (cards, buttons, etc.). I implemented 
the quiz without the need for routing, and primarily used component state to manage
navigation/results.

3. Describe the difficulties you faced (if any) while working on the challenge and how you tackled them.

One of the biggest challenges that I faced was figuring out how to deal with state
such that it was 'persistent' on the results page. I initially thought of doing this through 
localStorage (session state) because I originally wanted to route the quiz, but decided instead 
to use local navigation with state local to the main wrapper component (App.js). 

4. How much time you can spend each week working for DP Tech?

4 - 5 hours / week.
